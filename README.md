# Fedora Security Lab

The Fedora Security Lab provides a safe test environment to work on security auditing, forensics, system rescue and teaching security testing methodologies
in universities and other organizations.

The development of the **Fedora Security Lab (FSL)** (former known as **Fedora Security Spin**) provides a media which can be used as a live system.

Nowadays, there is more than just a Live media under the umbrella of the Fedora Security Lab. There is the [Fedora Security Lab Test bench](http://fedora-security-lab-test-bench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Ansible playbooks](https://pagure.io/security-lab/blob/master/f/ansible-playbooks) for package installations, and a comps groups.
